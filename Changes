Revision history for Perl extension Class::DBI::Lite.

0.031   2009-10-22
  - MANIFEST was missing t/lib/My/Fixtures.pm

0.030   2009-10-17
  - Added Class::DBI::Lite::Fixture for easy test fixtures.
  - Added tests for test fixtures.

0.029   2009-10-16
  - Added "ad hoc" queries.
  - Test coverage much better now.
  - Updated Artists/CDs example to Artists/Albums.

0.028   2009-08-22
  - Promoted _load_class to be a public method (as load_class($class) ).

0.027   2009-06-18
  - create() was calling discard changes after creation, which had the rare side-effect
    of reverting any values set by before_create triggers.

0.026   2009-06-12
  - Removed AUTOLOAD accessor/mutators.  Gained a performance increase (oh about 300%).

0.025   2009-04-17
  - Update to after_update_$field triggers to keep them from getting called
    over-and-over.

0.024   2009-04-07
  - Field-triggers were not getting called (eg: after_update_$field)

0.023   2009-04-06
  - Transactions that failed only warned.  Now they confess.

0.022   2009-04-05
  - Transactions work properly.
  - Added TableInfo and ColumnInfo.
  - Added class method 'Class->get_table_info()' which returns a TableInfo object.

0.021   2009-04-01
  - There was a rogue "commit" statement in DESTROY.  Removing it made transactions
    work properly.
  - Added test for transactions.

0.020   2009-03-20
  - Converted to Module::Install.
  - Added several tests, improved code-coverage.
  - discard_changes() now uses the __Changed->{$fieldname}->{oldval} data instead
    of re-retrieving the object from the database.
  - Fixed typo in error message for AUTOLOAD in Class::DBI::Lite.

0.019   2009-02-07
  - Broke schema metadata and entity metadata out into their own classes.
  - Metadata classes are schema/entity-partitioned singletons.
  - Initialization process is slightly different as a result of metadata changes.
  - Classes that subclass entity classes no longer have to call set_up_table(...).

0.018   2009-01-05
  - Subclasses of entity classes should no longer receive 
    errors like "Can't use an undefined value as a HASH reference"

0.017   2008-11-23
  - Use of has_a or has_many sometimes failed because _init_meta had not yet
    been called.

0.016   2008-10-27
  - db_Main database handle is now created with "AutoCommit = 1" to prevent a
    transaction deadlock in other code that uses Class::DBI::Lite::mysql.

0.015   2008-10-26
  - Object cache key now begins with the current database schema.

0.014   2008-10-24
  - Added "after_set_up_table()" event.

0.013   2008-10-12
  - Added Test::Memory::Cycle to dependencies list in Makefile.PL

0.012   2008-10-10
  - Updated some documentation.
  - has_a and has_many causes the other class to be loaded via require().

0.011   2008-10-09
  - Stable release of new version.
  - Fixed a bug under mod_perl which caused unstable behavior when each
    VirtualHost used a different database handle.  Sometimes a VirtualHost
    started talking to the wrong database (which is not good, obviously!).

0.010_01   2008-10-09
  - Complete rewrite.
  - Removed dependency on Class::Data::Inheritable.  Switched to simpler
    class-based "meta" hashrefs.
  - Improved performance.

0.009   2008-09-16
  - Added find_column().

0.008   2008-08-17
  - Added logic to ping() the DBI handle a maximum of once every 5 seconds.
    This should fix the bug that causes the occasional "white screen of death"
    after a web application has been idle for a long period.

0.007   2008-08-01
  - discard_changes() now correctly discards changes.
  - Updated POD to mention DBIx::Class and DBIx::Class::CDBICompat.
  - Added a memcycle test to check for any memory leaks.

0.006   2008-07-18
  - $obj->remove_from_object_index() removes it from memory AND the %Live_Objects cache.

0.005   2008-07-18
  - $obj->delete on an object that has_many will delete its has_many records
    via straight SQL unless the has_many class has before/after_delete triggers.
  - added new trigger events:
      before_set_$column( $s, $oldval, $newval )
      after_set_$column( $s, $oldval, $newval )
      before_update_$column( $s, $oldval, $newval )
      after_update_$column( $s, $oldval, $newval )
  - Updating a field value with the same value as the old value is ignored.

0.004   2008-07-18
  - All create/update/delete/add_to_* actions are performed within transactions.

0.003   2008-07-18
  - OK, *now* triggers are called on the correct objects.

0.002   2008-07-18
  - Triggers are now called on the correct object with the correct @_.

0.002_01  2008-07-17
  - Updated Makefile.PL to properly list all prerequisites.
  - Updated POD.

0.001 2008-07-16
