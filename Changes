Revision history for Perl extension Class::DBI::Lite.

0.008   2008-08-17
  - Added logic to ping() the DBI handle a maximum of once every 5 seconds.
    This should fix the bug that causes the occasional "white screen of death"
    after a web application has been idle for a long period.

0.007   2008-08-01
  - discard_changes() now correctly discards changes.
  - Updated POD to mention DBIx::Class and DBIx::Class::CDBICompat.
  - Added a memcycle test to check for any memory leaks.

0.006   2008-07-18
  - $obj->remove_from_object_index() removes it from memory AND the %Live_Objects cache.

0.005   2008-07-18
  - $obj->delete on an object that has_many will delete its has_many records
    via straight SQL unless the has_many class has before/after_delete triggers.
  - added new trigger events:
      before_set_$column( $s, $oldval, $newval )
      after_set_$column( $s, $oldval, $newval )
      before_update_$column( $s, $oldval, $newval )
      after_update_$column( $s, $oldval, $newval )
  - Updating a field value with the same value as the old value is ignored.

  - All create/update/delete/add_to_* actions are performed within transactions.
