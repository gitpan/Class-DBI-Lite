NAME
    Class::DBI::Lite - Lightweight ORM for Perl

EXPERIMENTAL STATUS
    **NOTE**: This module is still under development. It is likely to change
    in dramatic ways without any warning.

    As is, this module should not (yet) be used in a production environment
    until after v1.000.

SYNOPSIS
      package My::Model;
  
      use base 'Class::DBI::Lite';
  
      __PACKAGE__->connection(
        $Config->settings->dsn,
        $Config->settings->username,
        $Config->settings->password,
      );

    Then, elsewhere...

      # Change the connection:
      My::Model->connection( @dsn );
  
      my $users = My::User->retrieve_all;
  
      My::Model->connection( @other_dsn );
      my $other_users = My::User->retrieve_all;

DESCRIPTION
    This module is intended to serve as a drop-in replacement for the
    venerable Class::DBI when many features of Class::DBI are simply not
    needed, or when Ima::DBI's quirks are not wanted.

SEE ALSO
    The venerable Class::DBI.

    If you are looking for a modern, robust Perl ORM with a larger support
    community, check out DBIx::Class. It also has a Class::DBI combatibility
    layer - DBIx::Class::CDBICompat.
